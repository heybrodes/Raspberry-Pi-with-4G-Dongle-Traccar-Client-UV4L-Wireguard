# Raspberry-Pi-with-4G-Dongle-Traccar-Client-UV4L-Wireguard
This will connect a Raspberry Pi to a 4G network using a 4G USB dongle. And turn a Raspberry Pi into a traccer client that will plot its location onto a traccer.org server once connected to the 4G network with the help of a USB GPS receiver. And live stream audio and video from a UV4L built in streaming server with the help of a USB webcam.

The first thing to do is setup your Raspberry Pi with 32bit BULLSEYE Lite. At the time of writing I found that this is the only version that works properly for UV4L.
