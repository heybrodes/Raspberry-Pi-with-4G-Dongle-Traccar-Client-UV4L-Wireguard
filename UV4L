This will get UV4L streaming server working on Raspberry Pi3
1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

sudo rpi-update
echo /opt/vc/lib/ | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/vc.conf
sudo ldconfig

Enable the Legacy Camera support from the Interface Options menu of the following system command and reboot:

sudo raspi-config
sudo reboot

2. Add the repositories for UV4L:
$ curl https://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/lpkey.asc | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "deb https://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/raspbian/stretch stretch main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/uv4l.list

sudo apt-get update

3. Install UV4L
sudo apt-get install uv4l uv4l-raspicam
sudo apt-get install uv4l uv4l-server uv4l-uvc uv4l-server uv4l-webrtc uv4l-xmpp-bridge

4. Get your USB webcam device ID;
lsusb and your result should look similar to:

$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 2001:7e3d D-Link Corp. Mobile Connect
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0c45:6366 Microdia Webcam Vitade AF

The device ID for the webcam is 0c45:6366

5. See if the device is detected by UV4L using the following command;
uv4l --syslog-host localhost --driver uvc --device-id 0c45:6366

Your output should look something like:

<notice> [core] Trying to loading driver 'uvc' from built-in drivers...
<notice> [core] Loading driver 'uvc' from external plug-in's...
<notice> [driver] Video functionality 'Arducam USB Camera' recognized at 0c45:6366
<notice> [core] Device detected!
<notice> [core] Registering device node /dev/uv4l

Reboot

6. Goto http://ip_address:8090/ and you should see the UV4L streaming server main page. 
If you activate the 2 way audio & video the audio WILL NOT WORK YET!

7. To get audio working using the webcam microphone type the following:
arecord -L | grep CARD

The output will look something like;

Output will look something like this.

hw:CARD=Webcam,DEV=0
plughw:CARD=Webcam,DEV=0
default:CARD=Webcam
sysdefault:CARD=Webcam
front:CARD=Webcam,DEV=0
dsnoop:CARD=Webcam,DEV=0

Count the lines starting from zero at the top.
In the file /etc/uv4l/uv4l-uvc.conf, find the line that has the audio device index and set the index to the line number of you microphone. In my case, itâ€™s 2.

nano /etc/uv4l/uv4l-uvc.conf
server-option = --webrtc-recdevice-index=2 <---Remember to uncomment the line by removing the #

8. Reboot
Goto http://ip_address:8090/ and you should see the UV4L streaming server main page and when you start the stream you should hear audio as well.
