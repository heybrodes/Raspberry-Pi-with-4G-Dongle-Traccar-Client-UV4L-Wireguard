1. First test to see that the USB GPS receiver is working.

dmesg -T | grep tty

The first couple of lines talk about the serial port built into the Pi.
On the last line, however, a USB device is identified, which is most likely our GPS unit and
will be accessible as /dev/ttyUSBX. We can confirm that it's a GPS by trying to read
from it using the following command, where X should be replaced by the name
of your device:

sudo cat /dev/ttyUSBX ( or for something more prettier try: awk -F"," '/GGA/ {print $3,$5}' /dev/ttyUSBX

A GPS conforming to the NMEA standard will start flooding your screen with sentences beginning with a code such as
$GPGGA followed by comma-separated data, even if your GPS outputs binary garbage, it'll probably work fine.

Press Ctrl + C to stop the feed.

2. Create a script to send the GPS info to the Traccar server every 5 seconds.
I called mine track.sh

#!/bin/sh
i=0

while [ $i -lt 12 ]; do # 12 five-second intervals in 1 minute
  curl "http://traccar-FQDN-or-IP-address:5055/?id=<RPi-ID>&lat={0}&lon={1}&timestamp={2}" <--update this line with URL and device ID
  sleep 5
  i=$(( i + 1 ))
done

3. In cron insert;

sudo crontab -e
* * * * * /path/to/track.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1
